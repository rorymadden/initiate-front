Integrity. Transparency</span> </h2> </div> </div> <div class=row> <div class=col-lg-12> <p>Initiate Network was founded by a team of individuals who believe in the value and vital role associations play in their industry. Our founders include members that have worked on both the commercial and association side of conference organisations. Together, the team at Initiate have delivered over 100 events ranging in size from 50 to 22,000 attendees and have combined a stellar events process that is unbeatable in the marketplace. We created Initiate with the belief that we could help associations not only provide thought-leadership but to better connect with their industry. Conferences are a critical way to bring the industry together, but also can be a key revenue driver to fund mainstream association activities.</p> <p>Many associations understand the role a larger conference has to play but often lack the resources to deliver a non-core business activity. Other associations may ‘endorse’ an event from an independent conference organisation by marketing the event to members in return for branding. Initiate started because we believe that neither associations nor their industry were gaining long term benefits from these events and believed there was a better model for associations.</p> <p>We understand the detail needed to create a commercial conference, coupled with the unique needs of an association, including membership initiatives, regulatory and communications. We see our partnership model as offering better benefits for the association allowing us to build a more sustainable and long term relationship. This alleviates risk, maximises revenue and delivers vital exposure to new and existing association members.</p> <p>We do everything we can to ensure that associations do not have to pay upfront costs, or deviate from their core regulatory or other objectives.</p> <br> <p><strong>Location-Free Development</strong><br> Often international associations want to showcase the breadth of their membership by providing activities on a global scale. Our Location free networking, it doesn’t matter where you are in the world, with global connections we ensure your event is right for your audience.</p> <p>We believe in our commitment to facilitate associations engagement with their industry and to demonstrate their thought leadership and deliver more benefits to their members. Initiate has three simple mantras that we Initiate into everything we do: <ol> <li><span class=header>Accountability</span><br> From our low-risk offering to associations to our regular progress reports, we ensure we are accountable at all times for every action that we take on behalf of the association.</li> <li><span class=header>Integrity</span><br> Initiate understand the importance of integrity for associations. Our organisation has strong moral principles, each team member consistently upholds themselves to moral and ethical standards in every action and through every interaction. We will always put our partnering associations brand and objectives before professional short-term gains. This is evident in the clear documentation you receive, our marketing and sales process and our genuine interest for the betterment of our partner associations.</li> <li><span class=header>Transparency</span><br> We provide active openness and transparency in everything we do. We operate in such a way that it is easy for our partners to see what actions are performed. Our partnering associations have access to accounting, contractual and other documentation at all times.</li> </ol> </p></div> </div> </div> </section>   <section id=contact> <div class=container> <div class=row> <div class="col-lg-12 text-center"> <h2 class=section-heading>Contact Us<br>  </h2> <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">Please feel free to contact us today.</h3> </div> </div> <div class=row> <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-7 contact-details"> <h3>Email: <a href=mailto:"info@initiate.network">info@initiate.network</a></h3> <h3>Phone: +353 86 062 1267</h3> </div> <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-5 contact-why"> <ol> <li><p>Contact Us</p></li> <li><p>Free Consultation</p></li> <li><p>Identify Opportunity</p></li> <li><p>Agree and <strong><em>Initiate</em></strong></p></li> </ol> </div> </div> </div> </section> <footer> <div class=container> <div class=row> <div class=col-md-4> <span class=copyright>Copyright &copy; Initiate Network 2015</span> </div> <div class=col-md-4> <ul class="list-inline social-buttons"> <li><a href=#><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a> </li> <li><a href=#><i class="fa fa-facebook"></i></a> </li> <li><a href=#><i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i></a> </li> </ul> </div>  </div> </div> </footer> <script src=scripts/vendor.js></script> <script src=scripts/plugins.js></script> <script src=scripts/main.js></script> </body> </html>
